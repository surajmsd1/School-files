# Complete all of the following functions. Currently they all just
# 'pass' rather than explicitly return a value, which means that they
# implicitly return None. They all include doctests, which you can
# test by running this file as a script: python3 assign1.py

# Feel free to add your own doctests.

    The "three N plus 1" sequence starting from a positive integer n
    is defined as follows: if n is 1, stop; if n is odd, the next
    number is 3n+1; if n is even, the next number is n//2. For
    example, here's the sequence starting from 7:

        7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

    The function tnp1 must return the total length of the sequence
    starting from n, so

    >>> tnp1(7)
    17
    >>> tnp1(5)
    6
    >>> tnp1(11)
    15

    Remember that // performs integer division in Python.
